**ControlX**
---------------

ControlX is a Python project designed to transform your controller into a mouse substitute, providing an alternative way to interact with your computer. Please note that, as of now, ControlX has a known issue that may cause your computer to become unresponsive by opening too many Pygame documentation pages. We advise users not to clone or use the project in its current state.

**Features**
---------------

'Cursor Control': ControlX allows you to use your controller's joystick to control the mouse cursor on your computer screen, offering an intuitive and engaging navigation experience.

'Mouse Clicks': With ControlX, you can perform mouse clicks seamlessly using the buttons on your controller. This feature enhances your ability to interact with applications and content.

'Smooth Scrolling': The project incorporates smooth scrolling functionality using the controller's D-pad, enabling you to scroll through content effortlessly.

'Exit Functionality': By pressing the right trigger on the controller, you can conveniently exit the program, terminating the controller's mouse emulation.

**Known Issue and Current Status**
-----------------------------------

Important Note: ControlX is currently experiencing an issue that may lead to unintended consequences. Specifically, it may open multiple Pygame documentation pages, which can cause your computer to become unresponsive.

**Warning:** Due to this issue, we strongly advise against cloning or using ControlX in its current state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

**Work in Progress**
